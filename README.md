# Tensorflow-Tutorial
This is a tensorflow tutorial for a talk in ShenZhen University, I would also hope anyone who watches this tutorial can learn 
something useful. Besides of this tutorial, you can find some other tensorflow tutorial

Since this code is for teaching, I try to make it easily understandable instead of pursuing a good writing style. 
Thus, the programming style is not optimal. 
I would suggest you to find one of your own programming style and stick on it.
I found two codes in Github useful, you may refer to their style.

Besides of Tensorflow, there are also some wrapped toolboxs based on TF, you may find them easy to use. 
Wrapped toolboxs includesï¼š
Keras
TFLearn
skflow

I may further update this tutorial in future, keep attention.
